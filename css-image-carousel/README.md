# CSS Image Carousel

Just a prototype to test out and play primarily with the following concepts and technologies:

- CSS [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) in communication with JavaScript
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation
- [Choo JS framework](https://github.com/choojs/choo)

Nothing is set in stone and nothing is really finished. It's just for fun.
